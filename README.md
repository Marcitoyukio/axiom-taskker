# Axiom Taskker

This API is part of an academic project at FIAP in partnership with Ford, addressing the topic of the Nature of Work, with a focus on modernizing how people work together, especially in the context of remote work.

It's an API for a platform that centralizes communication and task organization, allowing users to announce their activities, update their progress, and coordinate their tasks effectively.

The solution was selected among the top 10 in the FIAP challenge with Ford.
